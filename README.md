# AI - Ena Marrow

Ena Marrow is a Discord horror bot built for immersive, psychological storytelling.  
She doesn’t just respond — she remembers, reacts, and evolves.  

This is not your typical chatbot. Ena operates on mood logic, ritual-based memory, and a twisted understanding of human behavior. She watches. She waits. She speaks when the silence gets loud.
